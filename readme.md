Lessons Learned -

It is easier to build the formatting for the page first before you create the functionality.<br/>
I was under the assumption that the solution to the weekend challenge was going to be self evident<br/>
given the amount of work that we had done in class but I quickly realized how out of my depth I was<br/>
and that I needed to realign my thinking.  I went from thinking about finishing the assignment to trying to<br/>
learn as much as I could about html/javascript and not obsess over making sure my project<br/>
looked as good as someone else's.<br/>
I realize that my final product is far from polished but I am hopeful to learn from the mistakes<br/>
I made this week and apply those lessons to my projects going forward.<br/>
